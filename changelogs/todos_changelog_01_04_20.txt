CHANGELOG:

Format:
- dd/mm/yy: change + info
            - extra info on indented line

Some entries marked with an asterisk may have changed:
[CHANGED ON dd/mm/yy]     -> a feature whose behaviour/implementation has
                              changed
[DEPRECATED ON dd/mm/yy]  -> a feature that has been removed
[IMPLEMENTED ON dd/mm/yy] -> a feature that was mentioned or whose framework
                              was added and has now been written
[ADDED TO ON dd/mm/yy]    -> a feature that has been added to

(other specific changes may be written in square brackets too if a certain
 reference in an older entry is still valid but something other than
 the feature itself has changed e.g. a renamed keyword)


IN PROGRESS:
implementing default commands - ones left to do:
- edit data
- edit tag name
- edit tag value


NEXT UP:
- add backward references or absolute references from root
- in api.manual_execute, add options to queue the command in command_queue or
  post_commands (with index)
- add ALL the plugin hooks for EACH API base function SEPRATELY
- dot parsing in command signatures (e.g. 2.1.3) and check if node.node.node is
  a valid or child that exists


TODOS:

[API and plugins]

- consider adding a 'master' command execution hook so that a plugin can 
  intercept command calls and delegate calls to their custom hooks instead
  of hard-coded hook names (for default commands)
  - commands will need to have IDs
  - this could allow plugins to interact

add back input_handler function and pre-written functions like
get_yes_or_no from the unseen pre-pre-release version

- add environment variables $depth $data (perhaps?)


[Commands-related things]
- add float/drop/copy commands
- add search option

- make the 'in' command safe for use with any command that may call
  api.Tree.return_from_node
- add search finally
- consider having an undo option

- make a general command queue object to hold both command queue lists as one
  and know where new commands should be added


[Input-related things]
None at the moment
